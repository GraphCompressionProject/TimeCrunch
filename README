To run:
   
   Change lines 1 and 2 of struc_extractor.m -- 'input_dir' should point to the original data directory, 'ext' refers to the extension of the graph files.  These should be in the format 'srcnode dstnode\n' with nodes numbered from 1.

   Change line 4 of run_structureDiscovery.m to point to the data path in which you would like the static, per-graph summaries to be output.

   Run struc_extractor.m -- this will produce static summaries for each of the input graphs.

   Copy the contents of stitching/ to the directory with the static summaries, and change the appropriate parameters in lines 1-4 to point to graph and model filelists (pathnames should be absolute in these -- one path per line, in an ordered fashion), and set the desired number of temporal structures and similarity parameters, if needed.

   Run stitch.m to produce the temporal summary.

   Use the scripts MDL/tscore.py, MDL/tgreedy.py to score and select the relevant models.  These are to be used as follows: 'python MDL/tscore.py graph_flist.txt timecrunch.tmodel' or 'python MDL/tgreedy.py graph_flist.txt timecrunch.tmodel'.
